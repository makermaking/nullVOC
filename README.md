## nullVOC Background

When it came time to choose which mods I was going to use on my Micron+, I realized that the only option at the moment was 3DPF, a very good project, but in my opinion, it could have some improvements and a slightly more "Voron" aesthetic.

**nullVOC is based on:**
- [The original Nevermore](https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro) (Lots of good info on carbon filters on this page)
- [3DPF by @Jadecky](https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro) 
- [The ZeroFilter by @zruncho](https://github.com/zruncho3d/zerofilter)

This is one of the most complex projects I have done to date, and when designing it, I did not have a clear idea from the beginning. Therefore, the design is not very parametric due to poor organization during its creation, leading to numerous fusion errors when making the slightest change. I will try to improve the base file and upload the enhanced version, but this does not affect the final design itself, just in case you want to modify it.

**Some main features of nullVOC:**
- Designed to fit under the bed of the Micron+ without mods (3DPF does not fit in FORMBOT kits by default)
- Click-on lid
- Magnetically connected cartridge
- JST-XH connection or cable adapter
- Directed airflow
- Reduced hardware and printed parts by 50% when compared to 3DPF
